The last rays of sunset were pouring through the great Arc. I passed
under it, and met him face to face. I had left him far down the Champs
Elysées, and yet he came in with a stream of people who were returning
from the Bois de Boulogne. He came so close that he brushed me. His
slender frame felt like iron inside its loose black covering. He showed
no signs of haste, nor of fatigue, nor of any human feeling. His whole
being expressed one thing: the will, and the power to work me evil.

In anguish I watched him where he went down the broad crowded Avenue,
that was all flashing with wheels and the trappings of horses and the
helmets of the Garde Republicaine.

He was soon lost to sight; then I turned and fled. Into the Bois, and
far out beyond it—I know not where I went, but after a long while as
it seemed to me, night had fallen, and I found myself sitting at a
table before a small café. I had wandered back into the Bois. It was
hours now since I had seen him. Physical fatigue and mental suffering
had left me no power to think or feel. I was tired, so tired! I longed
to hide away in my own den. I resolved to go home. But that was a long
way off.
