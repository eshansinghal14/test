The pulpit being in the middle of the church, it followed that, when I
was turned toward it, whatever moved at the west end could not fail to
attract my eye. When the organist passed it was no wonder that I saw
him: I had simply miscalculated the interval between his first and his
second passing. He had come in that last time by the other side-door.
As for the look which had so upset me, there had been no such thing,
and I was a nervous fool.

I looked about. This was a likely place to harbour supernatural
horrors! That clear-cut, reasonable face of Monseigneur C——, his
collected manner and easy, graceful gestures, were they not just a
little discouraging to the notion of a gruesome mystery? I glanced
above his head, and almost laughed. That flyaway lady supporting
one corner of the pulpit canopy, which looked like a fringed damask
table-cloth in a high wind, at the first attempt of a basilisk to pose
up there in the organ loft, she would point her gold trumpet at him,
and puff him out of existence! I laughed to myself over this conceit,
which, at the time, I thought very amusing, and sat and chaffed myself
and everything else, from the old harpy outside the railing, who had
made me pay ten centimes for my chair, before she would let me in
(she was more like a basilisk, I told myself, than was my organist
with the anaemic complexion): from that grim old dame, to, yes, alas!
Monseigneur C—— himself. For all devoutness had fled. I had never yet
done such a thing in my life, but now I felt a desire to mock.

As for the sermon, I could not hear a word of it for the jingle in my
ears of

    “The skirts of St. Paul has reached.
     Having preached us those six Lent lectures,
     More unctuous than ever he preached,”

keeping time to the most fantastic and irreverent thoughts.

It was no use to sit there any longer: I must get out of doors and
shake myself free from this hateful mood. I knew the rudeness I was
committing, but still I rose and left the church.

A spring sun was shining on the Rue St. Honoré, as I ran down the
church steps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils,
pale violets from the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman
hyacinths in a golden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday
pleasure-seekers. I swung my cane and laughed with the rest. Some one
overtook and passed me. He never turned, but there was the same deadly
malignity in his white profile that there had been in his eyes. I
watched him as long as I could see him. His lithe back expressed the
same menace; every step that carried him away from me seemed to bear
him on some errand connected with my destruction.

I was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to
dawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It
began to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a
long way back—a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these
years: it was there, though, and presently it would rise and confront
me. But I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the
Rue de Rivoli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I
looked with sick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of
the fountain, pouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on
the far-away Arc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas
of grey stems and bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again
coming down one of the chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.

I left the river-side, plunged blindly across to the Champs Elysées
and turned toward the Arc. The setting sun was sending its rays along
the green sward of the Rond-point: in the full glow he sat on a bench,
children and young mothers all about him. He was nothing but a Sunday
lounger, like the others, like myself. I said the words almost aloud,
and all the while I gazed on the malignant hatred of his face. But he
was not looking at me. I crept past and dragged my leaden feet up the
Avenue. I knew that every time I met him brought him nearer to the
accomplishment of his purpose and my fate. And still I tried to save
myself.

I live in the Court of the Dragon, a narrow passage that leads from the
Rue de Rennes to the Rue du Dragon.

It is an “impasse”; traversable only for foot passengers. Over the
entrance on the Rue de Rennes is a balcony, supported by an iron
dragon. Within the court tall old houses rise on either side, and close
the ends that give on the two streets. Huge gates, swung back during
the day into the walls of the deep archways, close this court, after
midnight, and one must enter then by ringing at certain small doors on
the side. The sunken pavement collects unsavoury pools. Steep stairways
pitch down to doors that open on the court. The ground floors are
occupied by shops of second-hand dealers, and by iron workers. All day
long the place rings with the clink of hammers and the clang of metal
bars.

Unsavoury as it is below, there is cheerfulness, and comfort, and hard,
honest work above.

Five flights up are the ateliers of architects and painters, and the
hiding-places of middle-aged students like myself who want to live
alone. When I first came here to live I was young, and not alone.

I had to walk a while before any conveyance appeared, but at last, when
I had almost reached the Arc de Triomphe again, an empty cab came along
and I took it.

From the Arc to the Rue de Rennes is a drive of more than half an hour,
especially when one is conveyed by a tired cab horse that has been at
the mercy of Sunday fête-makers.

There had been time before I passed under the Dragon’s wings to meet my
enemy over and over again, but I never saw him once, and now refuge was
close at hand.

Before the wide gateway a small mob of children were playing. Our
concierge and his wife walked among them, with their black poodle,
keeping order; some couples were waltzing on the sidewalk. I returned
their greetings and hurried in.

All the inhabitants of the court had trooped out into the street. The
place was quite deserted, lighted by a few lanterns hung high up, in
which the gas burned dimly.

My apartment was at the top of a house, halfway down the court, reached
by a staircase that descended almost into the street, with only a bit
of passage-way intervening, I set my foot on the threshold of the open
door, the friendly old ruinous stairs rose before me, leading up to
rest and shelter. Looking back over my right shoulder, I saw _him,_ ten
paces off. He must have entered the court with me.

He was coming straight on, neither slowly, nor swiftly, but straight on
to me. And now he was looking at me. For the first time since our eyes
encountered across the church they met now again, and I knew that the
time had come.

Retreating backward, down the court, I faced him. I meant to escape by
the entrance on the Rue du Dragon. His eyes told me that I never should
escape.

It seemed ages while we were going, I retreating, he advancing, down
the court in perfect silence; but at last I felt the shadow of the
archway, and the next step brought me within it. I had meant to turn
here and spring through into the street. But the shadow was not that
of an archway; it was that of a vault. The great doors on the Rue du
Dragon were closed. I felt this by the blackness which surrounded me,
and at the same instant I read it in his face. How his face gleamed in
the darkness, drawing swiftly nearer! The deep vaults, the huge closed
doors, their cold iron clamps were all on his side. The thing which
he had threatened had arrived: it gathered and bore down on me from
the fathomless shadows; the point from which it would strike was his
infernal eyes. Hopeless, I set my back against the barred doors and
defied him.

                   *       *       *       *       *

There was a scraping of chairs on the stone floor, and a rustling as
the congregation rose. I could hear the Suisse’s staff in the south
aisle, preceding Monseigneur C—— to the sacristy.

The kneeling nuns, roused from their devout abstraction, made their
reverence and went away. The fashionable lady, my neighbour, rose also,
with graceful reserve. As she departed her glance just flitted over my
face in disapproval.

Half dead, or so it seemed to me, yet intensely alive to every trifle,
I sat among the leisurely moving crowd, then rose too and went toward
the door.

I had slept through the sermon. Had I slept through the sermon? I
looked up and saw him passing along the gallery to his place. Only
his side I saw; the thin bent arm in its black covering looked like
one of those devilish, nameless instruments which lie in the disused
torture-chambers of mediaeval castles.

But I had escaped him, though his eyes had said I should not. _Had_ I
escaped him? That which gave him the power over me came back out of
oblivion, where I had hoped to keep it. For I knew him now. Death and
the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago had sent
him—they had changed him for every other eye, but not for mine. I
had recognized him almost from the first; I had never doubted what he
was come to do; and now I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful
little church, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon.

I crept to the door: the organ broke out overhead with a blare. A
dazzling light filled the church, blotting the altar from my eyes. The
people faded away, the arches, the vaulted roof vanished. I raised my
seared eyes to the fathomless glare, and I saw the black stars hanging
in the heavens: and the wet winds from the lake of Hali chilled my face.

And now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon
dripping with spray; and beyond, the towers of Carcosa rose behind the
moon.

Death and the awful abode of lost souls, whither my weakness long ago
had sent him, had changed him for every other eye but mine. And now I
heard _his voice_, rising, swelling, thundering through the flaring
light, and as I fell, the radiance increasing, increasing, poured over
me in waves of flame. Then I sank into the depths, and I heard the King
in Yellow whispering to my soul: “It is a fearful thing to fall into
the hands of the living God!”
